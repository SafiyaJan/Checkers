# Checkers


Project Title – Checkers

Description - In this project I will be trying to recreate the classic game of Checkers. The game will implement artificial intelligence and multiplayer functionalities in order to make the game more interactive. Use of graphics will also be implemented in order to make the game more user friendly and once again, interactive and aesthetically pleasing. The game will follow the basic rules of checkers with a regular 8 by 8 game board with 2 players aiming to remove each other’s coins. The first player to remove all their opponent’s coins, wins the game.

Libraries and Features to be implemented:
-	I hope to use the pyGame and Tkinter libraries for project
-	I also hope to implement a component of artificial intelligence within the game, where the user is player 1 and player 2 is the computer and the computer will make a move that complements that move made by the user
-	I also hope to include some audio features at the startup of the game to make it more appealing

User Interface:
-	The user interface of the game will consist of multiple windows, where the first is the startup, the second is the actual   game board where the game will be played and other message boxes that will prompt user of an error or information
-	The entry window will display various option such as ‘Start Game’, ‘How to Play’ and ‘Exit’.
-	A timer will also be included that will measure the duration of the game and display it to the user

Features to be implemented by first milestone:
-	Complete the 2 player part of the game 
-	Finalize the graphics of the game (overall look)
-	Finalize the entry window design and the game board designs
